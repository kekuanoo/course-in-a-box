**Creating Digital Exhibits** is at once both a workshop and a set of online resources and materials to help students, faculty and staff at the University of Washington get started with digital exhibits. Materials included on this site are intended for beginner users, though we welcome those with advanced digital exhibit skills to use or remix these instructional resources as needed.

This workshop is prioritizes open source platforms and tools available through the [UW Libraries Digital Scholarship Platforms Service](https://ds.lib.uw.edu/). These tools - SPLOTS and Omeka - allow you to develop  digital exhibits and provide different levels of customization and support.

By the end of this resource, you should know about the basics of digital exhibits and how to begin using SPLOTS and Omeka to develop a project site for your items and collections.
