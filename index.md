Omeka Online is a set of online resources and materials to help students, faculty and staff at the University of Washington in getting familiar with Omeka, an open source web-publishing platform that allows you to generate an online digital collection.

<br>

Materials included on this site are intended for beginner users of Omeka. Some resources are built exclusively for specific instructional purposes such as the UW Libraries Digital Scholarship Summer Immersion (DSSI) program, facilitated multi-week online workshops, and in-class activities. For advanced Omeka users, we encourage you to connect with Libraries-affiliated staff who can provide more in-depth support through consultation.

<br>

We encourage you to read the syllabus created for DSSI as an example of how this work might be incorporated into the curriculum or the type of activities that might be useful for your classroom.

#### About this workshop

P2PU created Course-in-a-Box in 2014 as a free and lightweight tool for building online courses. We wanted to preserve the modular structure of MOOCs outside of the bulky (and often proprietary) environment of learning/content management systems. Course-in-a-Box is open-source, and we welcome contributions [on our Github repo](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box).
