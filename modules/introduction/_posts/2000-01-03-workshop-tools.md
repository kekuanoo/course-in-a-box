## Workshop tools

In this workshop, you will be working with two primary digital exhibit platforms: SPLOTS and Omeka.

<br>

### SPLOTS

A **SPLOT** has a couple definitions depending on who you ask. Some say that it stands for **S**mallest **P**ossible **O**pen **L**earning **T**ool. Others argue that it is an acronym for **S**implest **P**ortable **O**nline **L**iving **T**technology. No matter which thought you subscribe to, the key takeaways are that SPLOTS are meant to be used as a nimble, quick and accessible platform and that there is great value to be had from learners and educators sharing their work openly on the web. Most importantly, anyone can contribute to SPLOTS without creating an account OR requiring any personally identifiable information.

The structure of a SPLOT is pretty straightforward. On its surface, a SPLOT looks like a fun website that anyone can visit to contribute to an online collection. Peek behind the curtain and you will that the SPLOT is built using a specific Wordpress template. Those two templates, TRU Collector and TRU Writer, serve as the collection tools for images, descriptions, essays and more. Pulling back the curtain even more will allow you to see the platform where this is all located - Reclaim Hosting.

When you need a quick and easy solution to hosting an openly available collection with a straightforward user interface that is perfect for students to easily submit their contributions, **SPLOTS** is the answer. Need examples? Check out the list below:

- [Community Performance Toolbox](http://communityperformancetoolbox.org/). Example of TruWriter being used with a media-rich project that also has text.
- [Into the Pulterverse](https://engl210219.pulterpoems.buffscreate.net/). Example of TruWriter, with more space for text. Still can embed media.
- [Animal Body Plans](https://bio2290.trubox.ca/). Example of TruCollector, with class gathering data, using the “metadata” as part of learning.

### Omeka

**Omeka**, in contrast to a SPLOT, is a platform built to ingest and display hundreds of digital objects in a collection. An Omeka site is developed using three digital assets: items, collections and exhibits. You can use these building blocks to explain a narrative about a collection or provide a persuasive argument based on how you craft your content.

Omeka is a simple web publishing system that provides a great deal of customization and complexity depending on your needs and it does this all in one single seamless site. It is a free, open source platform that enables and promotes collaboration. It is easy for faculty and students to collaborate together with Omeka with the ability to add users with varying levels of access and designated roles.

A number of plug-ins are also available for Omeka which extends its utility. Plug-ins allow you to build timelines, create mobile tours, embed narrative web elements and more.
