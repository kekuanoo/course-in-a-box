## Learning environment

We have already mentioned a couple of different workshop tools, namely **SPLOTs** and **Omeka**. These are the digital exhibit platforms that we often use in UW Libraries workshops to read, design, build and showcase digital exhibits. Those tools, however, are ultimately hosted on another service entirely. This hosting service is called **Reclaim Hosting**.

## Reclaim Hosting

SPLOTs and Omeka are tools provided through the **UW Libraries Digital Scholarship Platforms Service** which is built on the Reclaim Hosting infrastructure. To access these tools, you need to [request an account](https://ds.lib.uw.edu/) through the service.

After you've requested an account, you will receive an email when your account is ready. Navigate to the [Digital Scholarship Platforms website](https://ds.lib.uw.edu/dashboard/) to log in to your dashboard. When you first log in, you have a very important decision to make: **your subdomain**.

## Subdomains

Your subdomain is the URL for your project. For example: entering in  "englishpublishing" will assign you ***englishpublishing***.ds.lib.uw.edu. This cannot be changed once you have chosen your subdomain, so choose it carefully.

**WARNING** Do not use “test” in the subdomain. Reclaim Hosting does not accept “test” as a subdomain and your account will need to be reset.
