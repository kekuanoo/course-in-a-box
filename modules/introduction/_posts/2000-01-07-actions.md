## Contribute to a SPLOT!

Now that you had an opportunity to check your knowledge and review some of the previous material, let's start contributing to a digital exhibit!

Check out the experimental [TRY SPLOTs!](http://libstory.ds.lib.uw.edu/trysplots/) site to add to a photo to the site's pool of items. To add an item, click on the **Add to pool** option and submit the secret access code: ***trysplots*** to enter.

As you add items, consider the implications of creating the following item metadata:

- Title
- Uploaded file
- Name of person who uploaded the item
- Description
- Source of image
- Categories
- Tags
- Notes to the editor

Think about how each of these data fields might contribute, exploit, reveal or otherwise impact contributors in an open space.
