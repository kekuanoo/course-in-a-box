## Installation

If you are looking to build your own full digital exhibits, whether through Omeka or SPLOTs, you need to have your own full installation of the platform. The installation process is facilitated through the use of a tool called **cPanel**.

>However, if you are currently participating in a digital exhibit workshop, skip ahead to the next page.

## cPanel

Once your subdomain has been selected, you will be taken to the cPanel - a hosting control panel that helps you manage your new subdomain. It lists a number of applications and tools that are now available to you via Reclaim Hosting.

As it is right now, nothing exists on your subdomain. You only have empty server space and a reserved area to host and store content. To access the tools you need, you have to install each of them. Luckily, the two most popular tools - Wordpress and Omeka - are the first two available in the cPanel list.

## Installing Omeka

Omeka has an easy installation process. From your dashboard, click on the Omeka icon, look for the **Install this application** button and click to install.

You’ll be taken to a multi-screen page. You should not need to change any settings on this screen. But do note that under the Settings heading, you’ll want to locate the **administrator username** and **password** there and write it down. Omeka automatically generates the administrator username and password for you. You can change your username and password to something meaningful at this time. This will be your username and password to log in as an administrator into Omeka. You may also use the Directory section to distinguish the site from others. For example, adding "engl131" to the Directory section will give you a course specific URL of, in this case, ***libpublishing.ds.lib.uw.edu/engl13/***.

Your “website title” will default to My cms. You can change your website title here to match the title of your project.
When you get to the bottom of the screen, click the Install button.

Once Omeka has installed, you’ll see a page with a link to your Omeka site and a link to the administrative login (URL ends in /admin/) for Omeka where you can add content and make changes to your site. An email will be sent to you with this information as well.

## Installing SPLOTs

SPLOTs is also a relatively easy installation and is almost completely self-sustaining once it is set up.

You should know that SPLOTs essentially act as a gathering mechanism rather than a standalone platform. SPLOTs are actually comprised of 2-3 main tools:

- Wordpress
- TRU Collector
- TRU Writer

Wordpress is the world's most popular website builder. It is a free and open-source content management system and is often used in conjunction with pre-built themes to develop websites and blogs. It acts as the framework in which two specific Wordpress themes, TRU Collector and TRU Writer, operate.

TRU Collector allows for a collection of items (termed "collectables") where contributions can be made without any logins. This is done by using a generic author account that is silently activated. The user never sees any sign of the innards of Wordpress but can create posts for each collectable. It focuses on item collections rather than site maintenance.

TRU Writer allows people to publish their writing, including rich media content, without needing to login or understand the backend of Wordpress. TRU writer is great for projects where multiple people are contributing or for classroom applications where many individuals need to publish content on the same site. It focuses on the writing rather than website building.

Similar to the process for installing Omeka, you begin by locating the cPanel. Depending on what you're trying to collect, you will need to install the appropriate tool. To find TRU Collector (items) and TRU Writer (text), click on All Applications. Both tools will be available in the Featured section of the applications list. Click on the appropriate tool, then click on the **Install this application** button.

Similar to Omeka, you can name the directory for your SPLOT. The URL for an example SPLOT made for this website is http://libstory.ds.lib.uw.edu/trysplots, which makes the directory "trysplots." And much like Omeka, the installation has generated an **administrator username** and **password**. Find it and write it down. When you get to the bottom of the page, click Install.

Once TRU Writer or TRU Collector has been installed, you’ll see a page with a link to your new site and a link to the administrative login (URL ends in /admin/) page.
