title: Getting Started with Digital Exhibits

## Getting Started with GitHub

Digital exhibits are websites that are edited and hosted ... [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

For a great basic primer on digital exhibits, check out [this fancy URL that doesn't go anywhere](https://thefanciestsiteyounevermade.org). If you get stuck at any point in the process, head to our [super cool community space](https://probablyaslackbutdontknowyet.net) and someone can help you out!

We can automatically generate all of the links in this guide if you type your GitHub username into the box below. You can also copy the links directly into your browser’s URL bar, though you’ll have to manually replace the text “your-github-username” with your GitHub username.

<!--<div id="ghUsername-intro">
If you tell us your username, we can prepare some links and make things a bit easier for you. If for some reason it doesn't work, replace 'your-github-username' with your GitHub username where you see links containing 'your-github-username'

This guide is a cohesive companion for building a course directly in GitHub’s web interface with minimal coding knowledge. While this is the simplest way to get started, please note that you will generally have to wait a few minutes before changes will appear on your live course website.

Optionally, if you’re comfortable setting up and working in local dev environments, you can [install and run Jekyll](https://nicolas-van.github.io/bootstrap-4-github-pages#run-jekyll-on-your-computer-to-speed-up-testing) to build your course locally and speed up testing.
