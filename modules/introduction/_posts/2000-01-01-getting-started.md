## What are Digital Exhibits?

Digital exhibits are websites that display library, museum, archival, popular and scholarly collections and exhibitions. Platforms like SPLOTs and Omeka allow you to showcase collections of digital images, text, and other multi-media formats in one seamless site. Digital exhibits can be created by an individual or as a group with multiple submissions and contributions.

By creating a digital exhibit, you can showcase a collection of objects and share detailed information about each of those items. Your collection and the objects themselves become part of a greater narrative throughout your digital exhibit. Platforms like SPLOTs and Omeka can provide you with pathways to connect those objects together to help create that narrative.
