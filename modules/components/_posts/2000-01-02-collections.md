## Collections

Think of collections like a bucket of content. Each bucket can contain any number of individual items, as much as you care to cram in there. And you can label or assign each bucket for a specific use. Perhaps you have one bucket for "soccer" and another for "volleyball." It makes sense, then, to place corresponding items into appropriate buckets based on these commonalities. But once you place an item into a bucket, it belongs only to that bucket. That's how collections work in digital exhibit platforms.

Each item on your site can only belong to one collection, but items can be switched from one collection to another at any time. Each collection can be based on a common topic, source or organizing principle. And collections can certainly be public-facing, but they could also be used internally for organization purposes only. No matter how you plan to use a collection, know that you can customize your organization for a variety of contexts that make the most sense for your archive.

To add items to a collection in Omeka, you first need to create a collection. And like items, collections have some basic metadata options to provide when you first create a new one. Once a collection is created, you can add an item by going to the item in your archive and selecting the collection from the drop-down menu.
