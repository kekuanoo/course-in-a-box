## Overview

**A definition of production**

> For this course, in order to think about the stages of producing an exhibit with Omeka, we’d like to borrow the concepts of Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production from the world of filmmaking. This is how those terms are broken down at the [Brooklyn College Department of Film](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/aca_visualmedia_film/2012_Production_Handbook_.pdf). Another definition is provided by the [Georgetown University Library](https://guides.library.georgetown.edu/c.php?g=75854&p=488087).

In film, the Production stage is everything you do to film and record the actual footage you use in your movie. Production involves filming on location including rehearsals, stage setting, logging dailies (raw, unedited film shot each day), and syncing days with audio. Going back to our example of *Nomadland*, production is the active filming of footage on set with actors like Frances McDormand, David Strathairn, Bob Wells and Swankie.

For this course, we’re thinking that Production is putting all the things you gathered and generated in the pre-production phase into an actual exhibit. This phase includes adding items, thinking about how those items are represented via metadata, making items accessible for your site visitors, how materials might be arranged in a collection, and how to do all of these things in your digital exhibit platform of choice.

In this module, we explore Items, Collections, metadata, accessibility, and provide quick links to step-by-step instructions on how to add, edit and otherwise manipulate objects online for a more accessible, metadata-friendly experience for your audience.

At the end of this module, you will be adding items directly into a digital exhibit.
