## Metadata & Accessibility

Exhibits are an opportunity to highlight a few items from a single collection or to put items from several collections in conversation with one another. Exhibits provide a way to bring items from an Omeka site together in conversation with one another through descriptive text. Simple pages can be added to describe your project as a whole in more detail. They become part of the overarching site navigation.

Exhibits, therefore, are composed of pages just like a website. Most exhibits begin with an initial page that introduces your exhibit. Additional pages are composed of items from your archive that you wish to highlight or relate to each other. We will talk a bit more about pages later in this course, but just know for now that there are easy ways to build pages within your Omeka site.

Like other aspects of your Omeka site, when creating an exhibit you will need to associate it with some metadata. In this case, your exhibit will need:
- A title
- A slug: the location of your exhibit that comes after your website (i.e. youromekasite.ds.lib.uw.edu/show/**your_exhibit**)
- Credits
- A description
- Tags (remember that we mentioned items AND exhibits can both be tagged)
- A theme
- An optional summary page
- A cover image

If you have pages that already exist, you can also add them when first adding your exhibit.
