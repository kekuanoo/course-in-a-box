## Metadata & Accessibility

By now, you have come across the terms metadata and accessibility and might be wondering exactly how they relate to your digital exhibit. First, letâ€™s provide a rough definition of each concept and dive a bit deeper into how they work in context of Omeka and SPLOTs.

**Metadata**
```
Simply, metadata is **data about data**. Metadata **IS data itself**, as it contains meaningful pieces of information that have meaning in relation to another piece of information. Like other forms of data, it can be stored, preserved and managed. And it **can be applied to anything**. A sound file is described in the same way that a book or a piece of graffiti can be described. For instance, they all can have a title, an author and a year created. And metadata **generally has little value on its own**.
```

**Accessibility**
```
Simply, accessibility is the practice of making your materials usable by as many people as possible. While we traditionally think about accessibility in relation to people with disabilities, the practice of making your materials accessible benefits many people - those with low bandwidth, mobile users, those who prefer to process information visually rather than textually, and so on. Accessibility **IS usability** as incorporating it will make the user experience better for all. It also has the advantage of improving search engine optimization, makes your site more flexible to be hosted elsewhere, and is often required by law.
