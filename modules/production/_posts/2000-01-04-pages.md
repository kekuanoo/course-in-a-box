## Simple Pages

As you begin building your projects, you will want to consider incorporating Simple Pages. Simple pages - or just pages - are the connective tissue of your Omeka site. They become part of your site's navigation and are used to describe your project in much more detail.

Whereas exhibits bring items together across collections, a page provides viewers insight into why and how you, as a digital curator, have brought items together. Pages can help audiences understand the goals of your project, how materials were gathered and collected, and provide justification on why items are - or aren't - included in a collection.

### Examples of Pages
- An "About" page for your site
- An essay about the materials on your site
- Your philosophy, ethos or manifesto to give insight to your design decisions
- Your methodology for item selection
- Narrative contextual information about your items

### Nesting Pages
"Nesting" a page is the process of displaying content inside other pages. Nesting provides organization for your site architecture and allows you to intuitively group content for navigational purposes. A nested page acts as a hierarchy of pages using the site navigation terminology of "Parent" and "child" to denote order of appearance and location within the exhibit's site architecture.

- An exhibit page
