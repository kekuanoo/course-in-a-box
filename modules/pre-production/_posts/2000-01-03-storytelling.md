title: Storytelling through digital exhibits

## Storytelling

Your digital exhibit is, essentially, a virtual experience for a visitor to your own curated museum. And a key component to your digital exhibit is storytelling. What story does your exhibit tell? How does it engage an audience? Who is that audience?

Exhibits and collections are rich story resources that can convey a lot of information. The story that you weave throughout the exhibit should be coherent and provide a meaningful experience to your audience. But how do you, as the curator, successfully use your materials and authority to establish an emotional connection with a virtual visitor?

You will need to identify the main concepts you are trying to convey (the story), items that will be featured to establish those concepts (the characters), the main narratives that will be featured throughout the collections you create (the plot points) and the layout and architecture of your exhibit and overall site (the setting).

You should also consider how layering stories or capturing stories within a story can be facilitated. Perhaps a specific image helps you to reinforce the idea that an artist was particularly prolific during a certain time period. But allowing visitors to take a deeper look at the image by exploring its metadata and origin might enable you to provide greater context and understanding of how and why the image was created.

Take a look at these exhibits and consider what stories they are trying to tell:
- [Histories of the National](http://mallhistory.org/)
- [Memento Mori: The Art of Death and Mourning](http://exhibits.usu.edu/exhibits/show/mementomori)
- [Cleveland Historical](https://clevelandhistorical.org/)
- [Goinâ€™ North](https://goinnorth.org)


In this way, brainstorming and storyboarding the look and feel of your digital exhibit is a great way to get started.
