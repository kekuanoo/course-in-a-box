## Materials

The purpose of your digital exhibit will ultimately tell a story, answer a question, make an argument, etc. Materials that are featured in your digital collections, therefore, help to support the purpose of your exhibit. The materials in your exhibit may be text, images, photo galleries, audio files, videos, and more. These component pieces are the inventory of your exhibit and should be mapped out accordingly.

Each of your exhibit materials should include elements of metadata. Metadata is exactly as it sounds - a set of data that describes other data. Different parts of your digital exhibit will give you an opportunity to provide types of metadata so your exhibit can be easily identified, attributed and dated. By using a consistent format for this metadata (much of which is provided directly by your digital exhibit tool), you will be able to create a standardized format that will inform others about your materials’ organization and provide insight into the inner workings of your project.

So, as you collect or create your materials, try to keep track of its metadata as well. Keep track of whoever made the material, when the material was created, whether or not the material was published somewhere, whether or not the material has copyright, what language the material is in, what file format it’s in--things like that.
