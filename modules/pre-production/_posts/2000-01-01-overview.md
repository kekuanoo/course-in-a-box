## Items

Items are the most basic unit of any digital exhibit platform. An item can be any digital object or file: a photograph, a work of art, a person, an idea. When you create an item in your SPLOT or Omeka site, you will need to describe the item and you can upload files to represent it, too. Items are the foundation on which you will build your digital exhibit.

When you adding an item, you will have an opportunity to set an “item type” as part of its creation. Item types are just the kind of thing the item is - a photograph, a work of art, an idea, etc. Many digital exhibit platforms, including Omeka, provide you with a built-in list of item types or you can create your own.

Descriptions for an item, along with an item type, are just two parts of what makes up that item's metadata. The list below contains some of the metadata that you can add to an item in Omeka:

- Title: A name given to the item
- Subject: The topic of the item
- Description: An account of the item
Source: A related resource from which the describe item is derived
- Creator: The party responsible for making the item
- Publisher: The party responsible for making the item available
- Contributor: A party responsible for making contributions to the item
- Rights: Information about the rights held in and over the items
- Format: The file format, physical medium or dimensions of the item

Additionally, you can also add tags to easily identify the item. Tags are keywords or phrases that describe a piece of data. Tags can be added to both items and exhibits, showing that you can begin to connect resources to each other through a variety of means (but we will get to exhibits later). Adding tags to your items and exhibits will enable the audience to "Browse by tag" and are often discoverability in a list or word cloud, depending on the site theme you choose.
