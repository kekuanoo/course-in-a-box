## Overview

**A definition of pre-production**

> For this course, in order to think about the stages of producing an exhibit with Omeka, we’d like to borrow the concepts of Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production from the world of filmmaking. This is how those terms are broken down at the [Brooklyn College Department of Film](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/aca_visualmedia_film/2012_Production_Handbook_.pdf) Another definition is provided by the [Georgetown University Library](https://guides.library.georgetown.edu/documentary).

In film, the Pre-Production stage is everything that you do before you start creating the actual footage and material you’ll use in your movie. So if we were to use the recent film ***Nomadland*** as an example, Pre-Production includes things like the director, Chloe Zhao, checking in with Frances McDormand to see if she’d like to do the movie. This is also where Zhao drove cross-country with a small development team, looking for sites to film at and taking test footage.

For this course, we’re thinking that Pre-Production is all the things you do before you start working with Omeka. It’s where you brainstorm ideas, list priorities, search for materials, create materials, sketch story arcs, and, most importantly, storyboard.

In this module, we explore ways to investigate your ideas so you can start planning for your digital exhibit. You will think about the materials you have at your disposal, the materials that you could gather and feature in your digital exhibits and how you might frame a story around your exhibit.

You will also learn about the brainstorming and storyboarding process and how it relates to digital exhibit planning. You will also have an opportunity to try creating your own digital exhibit storyboard.
