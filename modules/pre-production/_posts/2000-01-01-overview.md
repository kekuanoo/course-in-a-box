## Overview

In this module, we explore ways to investigate your ideas so you can start planning for your digital exhibit. You will think about the materials you have at your disposal, the materials that you could gather and feature in your digital exhibits and how you might frame a story around your exhibit.

You will also learn about the brainstorming and storyboarding process and how it relates to digital exhibit planning. You will also have an opportunity to try creating your own digital exhibit storyboard.
