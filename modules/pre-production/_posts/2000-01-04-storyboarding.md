## Brainstorming [and storyboarding]

Ready to start drafting your digital exhibit plan? Grab a pen and paper, open your favorite word processor or use our brainstorming template [link] and consider answering the following questions:

- What materials will you feature?
- What story are you trying to tell with your materials?
  - What is the overall purpose of your digital exhibit?
  - What is your point of view?
  - How does your material connect to the purpose of your exhibit?
- Who is your audience?
- What is the key question that will keep your visitor’s attention and your audience engaged? Keep in mind that this question should be explored through navigation and may likely be answered by the end of the “visit” to your exhibit.
- How are you pacing navigation of your exhibit? Do visitors move from text to text or are materials organized in a way that provides a variety of representation within the exhibit?
- By the end of your exhibit, what should the audience be able to articulate, what should they feel, how do you want them to react?

Storyboarding can take many forms. See the list below for examples:
