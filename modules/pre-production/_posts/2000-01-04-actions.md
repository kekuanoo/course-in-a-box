#### Crafting a narrative

Building a compelling digital exhibit often requires a framing of storytelling. As a curator of this exhibit and collections, consider the following questions:

- Who is the exhibit’s target audience and how do we know this?
- What is the argument or the narrative of the exhibit?
- How easy is it to navigate the exhibit from page to page, beginning to end?
- Is the text easy to read and understand and do the objects make sense in its context?
- Do you like the exhibit? How could it be improved?
- How will users navigate your exhibit and your items?
- Why did you choose your items?
- How do the items relate?

You are responsible for developing the narrative of your digital exhibit. And like many narratives, it can be helpful to investigate existing examples of stories told in the medium. Check out the following exhibits and consider reflecting on the questions in the list above as you explore the exhibit's collections:

- [Histories of the National](http://mallhistory.org/)
- [Memento Mori: The Art of Death and Mourning](http://exhibits.usu.edu/exhibits/show/mementomori)
- [Cleveland Historical](https://clevelandhistorical.org/)
- [Goin’ North](https://goinnorth.org)

While anyone can view the websites, there is usually a specific targeted audience for each exhibit. Some of the exhibits make compelling and persuasive arguments from a particular stance. Exhibits may also have a very specific way of navigating through the site, whether that is linearly like through a timeline of events or a more non-linear representation of items that allow you to skip around based on your preferences. As a viewer, you may end up following the narrative that the curator developed or you could wind up creating your own narrative based on the connected items you viewed.

Either way, notice how these digital exhibits attempt to connect items to tell a story and to guide their audience along a narrative journey. As a curator yourself, your goal is to arrange items and pages in an enjoyable way for your visitors. Activities like storyboarding, concept mapping and site mapping can help you visualize how to organize your content into a logical sequence for your audience.
