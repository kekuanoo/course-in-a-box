## Exhibits

Exhibits are an opportunity to highlight a few items from a single collection or to put items from several collections in conversation with one another. Exhibits provide a way to bring items from an Omeka site together in conversation with one another through descriptive text. Simple pages can be added to describe your project as a whole in more detail. They become part of the overarching site navigation.

Exhibits, therefore, are composed of pages just like a website. Most exhibits begin with an initial page that introduces your exhibit. Additional pages are composed of items from your archive that you wish to highlight or relate to each other. We will talk a bit more about pages later in this course, but just know for now that there are easy ways to build pages within your Omeka site.

Like other aspects of your Omeka site, when creating an exhibit you will need to associate it with some metadata. In this case, your exhibit will need:
- A title
- A slug: the location of your exhibit that comes after your website (i.e. youromekasite.ds.lib.uw.edu/show/**your_exhibit**)
- Credits
- A description
- Tags (remember that we mentioned items AND exhibits can both be tagged)
- A theme
- An optional summary page
- A cover image

If you have pages that already exist, you can also add them when first adding your exhibit.

## Exhibit architecture

Before you begin organizing your exhibit, you should first have **at least** a rough outline of your exhibit including the assets you will need for your display. These assets should be uploaded and added as items in Omeka.

As you recall, items are a primary building block of an Omeka site. With this in mind, consider what you want to do to fully describe and showcase your items. Sets of items can also be selected as a way to guide visitors who are browsing your site, so consider how you might group items into sets together and what metadata they may have in relation.

Once you have added items and decided what you want your items to do in your exhibit, consider how you take use of their functionality and data properties you have described. Will you display items by "author" or will your audience see a different categorization or item set based on some other metadata field?

Now you need pages. So, what pages do you include, what content do you want to feature, and how will you arrange and organize the pages? Sketching or storyboarding your site's architecture could be a helpful guide as you build your pages.

Finally, consider how you might interact with your audience. Will they be active contributors to a collection? Can they share your methodology, process and other information via social media? What do you want them to take away from your digital exhibit?

All good things to consider when building the architecture for your exhibits.

## Customizing the exhibit page layout

We alluded to the idea of designing the pages in your exhibit with a specific purpose. And depending on your desired outcomes, you can select a few options to be viewable on your exhibit page through existing layouts.

- **File with text.** A file can be included in-line with surrounding text.
- **Gallery.** While some text is allowed, this layout has a focus for digital media.
- **Text.** A text-only option with no additional digital files.
- **File**. A standalone file on a page.

Adding a page through the Exhibit Builder tool will allow you to customize the look and feel throughout your exhibit.
