## Exhibit architecture

Before you begin organizing your exhibit, you should first have **at least** a rough outline of your exhibit including the assets you will need for your display. These assets should be uploaded and added as items in Omeka.

As you recall, items are a primary building block of an Omeka site. With this in mind, consider what you want to do to fully describe and showcase your items. Sets of items can also be selected as a way to guide visitors who are browsing your site, so consider how you might group items into sets together and what metadata they may have in relation.

Once you have added items and decided what you want your items to do in your exhibit, consider how you take use of their functionality and data properties you have described. Will you display items by "author" or will your audience see a different categorization or item set based on some other metadata field?

Now you need pages. So, what pages do you include, what content do you want to feature, and how will you arrange and organize the pages? Sketching or storyboarding your site's architecture could be a helpful guide as you build your pages.

Finally, consider how you might interact with your audience. Will they be active contributors to a collection? Can they share your methodology, process and other information via social media? What do you want them to take away from your digital exhibit?

All good things to consider when building the architecture for your exhibits.
