## Crafting a narrative

Building a compelling digital exhibit  requires a framing of storytelling. As a curator of this exhibit and collections, consider the following questions:

- Who is the exhibitâ€™s target audience and how do we know this?
- What is the argument or the narrative of the exhibit?
- How easy is it to navigate the exhibit from page to page, beginning to end?
- Is the text easy to read and understand and do the objects make sense in its context?
- Do you like the exhibit? How could it be improved?
- How will users navigate your exhibit and your items?
- Why did you choose your items?
- How do the items relate?
