## Let's revisit our example exhibits

Let's pause for a moment and go back to the four exhibits we visited in the pre-production stage.

- [Histories of the National](http://mallhistory.org/)
- [Memento Mori: The Art of Death and Mourning](http://exhibits.usu.edu/exhibits/show/mementomori)
- [Cleveland Historical](https://clevelandhistorical.org/)
- [Goinâ€™ North](https://goinnorth.org)

While anyone can view these websites, there is usually a specific targeted audience for each exhibit. Some of the exhibits make compelling and persuasive arguments from a particular stance. Exhibits may also have a very specific way of navigating through the site, whether that is linearly like through a timeline of events or a more non-linear representation of items that allow you to skip around based on your preferences. As a viewer, you may end up following the narrative that the curator developed or you could wind up creating your own narrative based on the connected items you viewed.

Either way, notice how these digital exhibits attempt to connect items to tell a story and to guide their audience along a narrative journey. As a curator yourself, your goal is to arrange items and pages in an enjoyable way for your visitors.

In just a moment, we will revisit your brainstorming document and storyboard to see if you've achieved your goals.

But first, let's do one last knowledge check as a review of this module.
