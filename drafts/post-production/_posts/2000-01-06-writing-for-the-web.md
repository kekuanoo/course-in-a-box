## Writing for the web

As you consider text for your simple pages, remember writing in a digital format is much different than writing a research work or term paper. Youâ€™ll want to keep your text short, concise, and easy to scan. Put the most important content or message on your simple page first rather than burying it at the end of the text. If you have multiple paragraphs, use headings to break them up. This is also good practice for the accessibility of your site.

Consider [these guidelines](https://education.uw.edu/my-coe/web-writing-guidelines) from the UW College of Education.

1. **Write clear, simple and effective content.**
2. **Put the most important content in the first paragraph.**
3. **Chunk your content.**
4. **Be concise.**
5. **Use active voice instead of passive voice.**
6. **Choose lists over long paragraphs.**

## Accessibility
You also need to ensure that your digital exhibits are designed with accessibility in mind. This means you make good use of headings, images have alternative text, you use meaningful hyperlinks, and your site can be navigated by keyboard-only.
