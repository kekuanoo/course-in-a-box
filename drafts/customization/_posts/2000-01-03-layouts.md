## Customizing the exhibit page layout

We alluded to the idea of designing the pages in your exhibit with a specific purpose. And depending on your desired outcomes, you can select a few options to be viewable on your exhibit page through existing layouts.

- **File with text.** A file can be included in-line with surrounding text.
- **Gallery.** While some text is allowed, this layout has a focus for digital media.
- **Text.** A text-only option with no additional digital files.
- **File**. A standalone file on a page.

Adding a page through the Exhibit Builder tool will allow you to customize the look and feel throughout your exhibit.
