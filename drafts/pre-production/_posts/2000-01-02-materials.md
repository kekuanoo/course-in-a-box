## Materials

The purpose of your digital exhibit will ultimately tell a story, answer a question, make an argument, etc. Materials that are featured in your digital collections, therefore, help to support the purpose of your exhibit. The materials in your exhibit may be text, images, photo galleries, audio files, videos, and more. These component pieces are the inventory of your exhibit and should be mapped out accordingly.

Each of your exhibit materials should include elements of metadata. Metadata is exactly as it sounds - a set of data that describes other data. Different parts of your digital exhibit will give you an opportunity to provide types of metadata so your exhibit can be easily identified, attributed and dated. By using a consistent format for this metadata (much of which is provided directly by your digital exhibit tool), you will be able to create a standardized format that will inform others about your materialsâ€™ organization and provide insight into the inner workings of your project.
